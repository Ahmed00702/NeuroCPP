# Simple Neural Network Library (C++)

A simple neural network library written in modern C++.  
Currently includes basic `Neuron` and `Layer` classes, with a `NeuralNetwork` class planned for future releases.  
This project focuses on clarity and learnability rather than advanced features or high performance, making it useful for studying neural network fundamentals or building small experimental models in C++.

A lot of time was spent on adding comments explaining everything to make learning easy.

## Features

- ✔ Basic **Neuron** class  
- ✔ Basic **Layer** class  
- ⏳ **NeuralNetwork** class coming soon  
- ✔ Clean modern C++ design  
- ✔ Easy to read and modify
- ✔ Q-Table class

## Project Goals

- Provide a simple, minimal implementation of neural network components, along with some additional machine learning classes (such as Q-Tables)  
- Serve as an educational resource for C++ developers learning about machine learning  
- Keep the codebase small, clean, and understandable
