# Simple Neural Network & Q-Learning Library (C++)

Copyright (c) 2025 Ahmed Shahin

A simple neural network and Q-learning library written in **modern C++20**.  
This project uses **C++20 modules** for cleaner code organization and faster compilation, eliminating traditional header/source file separation.  

Currently includes:

- **Neuron** module (`Neuron.ixx`)  
- **Layer** module (`Layer.ixx`)  
- **QTable** module (`QTable.ixx`)  

A `NeuralNetwork` class is planned for future releases.  
The library focuses on **clarity and learnability**, making it useful for studying neural network fundamentals, reinforcement learning, or building small experimental models in C++.

A lot of time was spent on adding comments explaining everything to make learning easy.

## Features

- ✔ Basic **Neuron** module  
- ✔ Basic **Layer** module  
- ✔ **QTable** module for reinforcement learning  
- ⏳ **NeuralNetwork** class coming soon  
- ✔ Clean **C++20 modular design**  
- ✔ Easy to read, modify, and extend

## Requirements

- **C++20 compiler** (for module support)  
- Works on **Visual Studio 2022+**, **GCC 12+**, or **Clang 16+**  
- No external dependencies

## Project Goals

- Provide a simple, minimal implementation of neural network components and Q-learning tables  
- Serve as an **educational resource** for C++ developers learning machine learning  
- Keep the codebase **small, clean, and understandable**  
- Demonstrate modern C++20 **modules** in practice
