# Simple Neural Network Library (C++)

A simple neural network library written in modern C++.  
Currently includes basic `Neuron` and `Layer` classes, with a `NeuralNetwork` class planned for future releases.  
This project focuses on clarity and learnability rather than advanced features or high performance, making it useful for studying neural network fundamentals or building small experimental models in C++.

## Features

- ✔ Basic **Neuron** class  
- ✔ Basic **Layer** class  
- ⏳ **NeuralNetwork** class coming soon  
- ✔ Clean modern C++ design  
- ✔ Easy to read and modify

## Project Goals

- Provide a simple, minimal implementation of neural network components  
- Serve as an educational resource for C++ developers learning about machine learning  
- Keep the codebase small, clean, and understandable
